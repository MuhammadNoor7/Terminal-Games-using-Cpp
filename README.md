# These are some  C++ games I made during my first semester course CS1002 Programming : 


1) Calculator : Generates arithmetic exercises based on user input for the type of operation (+, -, *, /) and whether negative numbers are allowed. It then asks the user to solve the exercise and checks their answers . Moreover,  Uses random number generation, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

2) Even/Odd Game : This C++ program simulates a game of Even and Odds where the computer plays as Even and the user plays as Odds. The user inputs a number between 1 and 10, and the program randomly generates an even number for the computer, determining the winner based on whether their sum is even or odd, and keeps track of the scores.


3) Matching Grid : This C++ program checks if two user-provided indices correspond to the same or different color boxes in a predefined grid. It uses conditional checks and modular arithmetic to determine color matching and outputs the result.


4) High Low : Simulates a higher or lower guessing game where the user guesses if a second random number will be higher or lower than the first.
   

5) Rock Paper Scissor : Simulates a rock-paper-scissors game and outputs the results with specific winner announcement.


6) Guessing Game : a number guessing game with multiple rounds and user interaction .


7) Pacman : This program simulates a basic version of the Pac-Man game. The player navigates through a maze, avoiding monsters while collecting dots. The game ends if the player collides with a monster or collects all dots.



8)  Spiral Rotation :   This code generates a 2D array with random values and then prints the elements in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner.
