# These are some  C++ games I made during my first semester course CS1002 Programming : 


1) Calculator : Generates arithmetic exercises based on user input for the type of operation (+, -, *, /) and whether negative numbers are allowed. It then asks the user to solve the exercise and checks their answers . Moreover,  Uses random number generation, user input handling, and basic arithmetic operations.


2) Matching Grid : This C++ program checks if two user-provided indices correspond to the same or different color boxes in a predefined grid. It uses conditional checks and modular arithmetic to determine color matching and outputs the result.


3) High Low : Simulates a higher or lower guessing game where the user guesses if a second random number will be higher or lower than the first.
   

4) Rock Paper Scissor : Simulates a rock-paper-scissors game and outputs the results with specific winner announcement.


5) Guessing Game : a number guessing game with multiple rounds and user interaction .


6) Pacman : This program simulates a basic version of the Pac-Man game. The player navigates through a maze, avoiding monsters while collecting dots. The game ends if the player collides with a monster or collects all dots.



7)  Spiral Rotation :   This code generates a 2D array with random values and then prints the elements in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner.
